Discussions
===========

Each project has a discussion forum. 

Each discussion can also be linked to a specific documentation page. This allows users viewing a documentation page to scroll down and immediately see relevant discussions.

The aim of these discussions is for Q&A regarding documentation or "how to" questions, and users providing helpful tips or code examples.

To increase participation, guest users can also participate in the discussions. This can be changed and limited by the project maintainer.

When viewing a page, any discussions created about it and its descendants will be visible as page discussions.
For example, when viewing a class page, all discussions asked about itself and any of its methods pages will be visible.
