## Broken image links

Doxiz doesn't store images locally. Your images should have link to an absolute external url.

- Github users should use the following url format:
    
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/filename`.
    
    inside a markdown file it would look like:
    
    `![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repository/branch/filename)`
    
    If the file is inside a wiki repository, it can be accessed in the following way:
    
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/user/repository/filename`
